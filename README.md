## Web Sockets in rust ----USING(tokio & std ) Library only.
This is just an example i have made how the websockets work in rust using tokio and not a framework like actix-web or axum.

### Use of this ---->
We can use thsi simple example to set up a proper websocket connection and use it in creating a real time dual connection for real time updates.
